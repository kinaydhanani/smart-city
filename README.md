# smart-city
Smart city project has provided an online platform for waste disposal in the city. The user can take a photo of the garbage lying around his residence and send a request to the municipal corporation's cleaning department. The request will also be visible to the garbage collector. The garbage collector will look at the request through the map and start cleaning it and also update its status so that it can be seen by the municipal corporation as well as the user. A clean image will be sent to the cleaning department after the garbage is cleaned. Points will also be awarded to the user for those sent requests.
